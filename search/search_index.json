Gaining access is critical for all remaining exercises.\n\n\nLogging In\n\u00b6\n\n\nToday, you will use a submit server named \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, which will allow you to submit jobs to our local HTCondor pool in CHTC.\n\n\nTo log in, use a \nSecure Shell\n (SSH) client.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a Mac or Linux computer, run the Terminal app and use the \nssh\n command, like so:\n\n\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ssh \n<USERNAME>\n@learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, we recommend a free client called \nPuTTY\n, but any SSH client should be fine.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need help finding or using an SSH client, ask the instructors for help right away\n!\n\n\nAbout Your Password\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nYour username and initial password are located on the Accounts sheet of paper that you received this morning\n\n\nWhile the \npasswd\n command will work (and will change your password temporarily), your initial password will be automatically reset for you on an hourly basis. (So you probably don't want to change your password, in the first place, and definitely want to keep your sheet of paper or memorize the password).\n\n\n\n\nRunning Commands\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the exercises, we will show commands that you are supposed to type or copy into the command line, like this:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n hostname\n\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the first line of the example above, the \nusername@learn $\n part is meant to show the Linux command-line prompt.\nYou do not type this part! Further, your actual prompt probably is a bit different, and that is expected.\nSo in the example above, the command that you type at your own prompt is just the eight characters \nhostname\n.\nThe second line of the example, without the prompt, shows the output of the command; you do not type this part,\neither.\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few other commands that you can try (the examples below do not show the output from each command):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n whoami\n\nusername@learn $\n date\n\nusername@learn $\n uname -a\n\n\n\n\n\nA suggestion for the day: Try typing into the command line as many of the commands as you can. Copy-and-paste is fine, of course, but \nyou WILL learn more if you take the time to type each command, yourself.\n\n\nOrganizing Your Workspace\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou will be doing many different exercises over the next few days, many of them on this submit server. Each exercise may use many files, once finished. To avoid confusion, it may be useful to create a separate directory for each exercise.\n\n\nFor instance, for the rest of this exercise, you may wish to create and use a directory named \nmonday-1.1-login\n, or something like that.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n mkdir Mon\n\nusername@learn $\n mkdir Mon/1.1\n\nusername@learn $\n \ncd\n Mon/1.1\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the Version of HTCondor\n\u00b6\n\n\nHTCondor is installed on this server. But what version? You can ask HTCondor itself:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_version\n\n$\nCondorVersion: \n8\n.9.2 May \n13\n \n2019\n BuildID: \n469000\n PackageID: \n8\n.9.2-0.469000 $\n\n$\nCondorPlatform: x86_64_RedHat7 $\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the output, we are using HTCondor 8.9.2.\n\n\nFYI: Background information about HTCondor version numbers\n\u00b6\n\n\nHTCondor always has two types of releases at one time: stable and development. HTCondor 8.6.x and 8.8.x are considered stable releases, indicated by even-numbered second digits (e.g., 6 or 8 in these cases). Within one stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 8.6.0 and 8.6.8 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug and security fixes.\n\n\nHTCondor 8.9.2 is the latest \ndevelopment\n release series of HTCondor. You know that these are a development release because the second digit (i.e., 9) is an odd number. CHTC is usually running the latest development series as the local CHTC Pool is somewhat of a final testing ground for new features. Other HTCondor pools and submit servers that you use outside of CHTC (including the OSG submit server you'll use later) may run different versions. In general, the user-facing HTCondor features in 8.6 forward are mostly the same, but you may see some differences in the format of output from \ncondor_\n commands or in more advanced or non-user features.\n\n\nReference Materials\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere are a few links to reference materials that might be interesting after the school (or perhaps during).\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor home page\n\n\nHTCondor manuals\n; it is probably best to read the manual corresponding to the version of HTCondor that you use (8.9.2 for today)\n\n\nCenter for High Throughput Computing\n, our campus research computing center, and home to HTCondor and other development of distributed computing tools",

Within one stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 8.6.0 and 8.6.8 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug and security fixes.  HTCondor 8.9.2 is the latest  development  release series of HTCondor. You know that these are a development release because the second digit (i.e., 9) is an odd number. CHTC is usually running the latest development series as the local CHTC Pool is somewhat of a final testing ground for new features. Other HTCondor pools and submit servers that you use outside of CHTC (including the OSG submit server you'll use later) may run different versions. In general, the user-facing HTCondor features in 8.6 forward are mostly the same, but you may see some differences in the format of output from  condor_  commands or in more advanced or non-user features.",

This is a huge step in learning to use an HTC system!\n\n\nThis exercise will take longer than the first two, short ones. It is the essential part of this exercise time. If you are having any problems getting the jobs to run, please ask the instructors! It is very important that you know how to run simple jobs.\n\n\nRunning a Simple Job\n\u00b6\n\n\nNearly all of the time, when you want to run an HTCondor job, you first write an HTCondor submit file for it. In this section, you will run the same \nhostname\n command as in Exercise 1.1, but where this command will run within a job on one of the 'execute' servers in CHTC's local HTCondor pool.\n\n\nHere is a simple submit file for the \nhostname\n command:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/hostname\n\noutput = simple.out\nerror = simple.err\nlog = simple.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite those lines of text in a file named \nsimple.sub\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is nothing magic about the name of an HTCondor submit file.\nIt can be any filename you want.\nIt's a good practice to always include the \n.sub\n extension, but it is not required.\nUltimately, a submit file is a text file\n\n\n\n\nThe lines of the submit file have the following meanings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexecutable\n\n\nThe name of the program to run (relative to the directory from which you submit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write the standard output from your job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write the standard error from your job. This particular job is not likely to have any, but it is best to include this line for every job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write information about your job run. Technically not required, it is a \nreally\n good idea to have a log file for every job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_*\n\n\nTells HTCondor how many \ncpus\n and how much \nmemory\n and \ndisk\n we want, which is not much, because the 'hostname' executable is pretty simple\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueue\n\n\nTells HTCondor to run your job with the settings above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we are not using the \narguments\n or \ntransfer_input_files\n lines that were mentioned during lecture because the \nhostname\n program is all that needs to be transferred from the submit server, and we want to run it without any additional options.\n\n\nDouble-check your submit file, so that it matches the text above. Then, tell HTCondor to run your job:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit simple.sub\n\nSubmitting job(s).\n\n\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster NNNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual cluster number will be shown instead of \nNNNN\n. \nIf, instead of the text above, there are error messages, read them carefully and then try to correct your submit file or ask for help.\n\n\nNotice that \ncondor_submit\n returns back to the shell prompt right away. It does \nnot\n wait for your job to run. Instead, as soon as it has finished submitting your job into the queue, the submit command finishes.\n\n\nView your job in the queue\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow, use \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n to watch for your job in the queue! \n\n\nYou may not even catch the job in the \nR\n running state, because the \nhostname\n command runs very quickly. When the job itself is finished, it will 'leave' the queue and no longer be listed in the \ncondor_q\n output.\n\n\nAfter the job finishes, check for the \nhostname\n output in \nsimple.out\n, which is where job information printed to the terminal screen will be printed for the job.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n cat simple.out\n\ne171.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsimple.err\n file should be empty, unless there were issues running the \nhostname\n executable after it was transferred to the slot. The \nsimple.log\n is more complex and will be the focus of a later exercise.\n\n\nRunning a Job With Arguments\n\u00b6\n\n\nVery often, when you run a command on the command line, it includes arguments (i.e. options) after the program name, as in the below examples:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n cat simple.out\n\nusername@learn $\n sleep \n60\n\n\nusername@learn $\n dc -e \n'6 7 * p'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an HTCondor submit file, the program (or 'executable') name goes in the \nexecutable\n statement and \nall remaining arguments\n go into an \narguments\n statement. For example, if the full command is:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n sleep \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in the submit file, we would put the location of the \"sleep\" program (you can find it with \nwhich sleep\n) as the job \nexecutable\n, and \n60\n as the job \narguments\n:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/sleep\narguments = 60\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the command-line command:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n dc -e \n'6 7 * p'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would put the following into the submit file, putting the \narguments\n statement in quotes, since it contains single quotes:\n\n\nexecutable = /usr/bin/dc\narguments = \"-e '6 7 * p'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s try a job submission with arguments. We will use the \nsleep\n command shown above, which simply does nothing for the specified number of seconds, then exits normally. It is convenient for simulating a job that takes a while to run.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file (you name it this time) and save the following text in it.\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/sleep\narguments = 60\n\noutput = sleep.out\nerror = sleep.err\nlog = sleep.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept for changing a few filenames, this submit file is nearly identical to the last one. But, see the extra \narguments\n line?\n\n\nSubmit this new job. Again, watch for it to run using \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n; \ncheck once every 15 seconds or so. \nOnce the job starts running, it will take about 1 minute to run (because of the \nsleep\n command, right?), \nso you should be able to see it running for a bit. \nWhen the job finishes, it will disappear from the queue, but there will be no output in the output or error files, because \nsleep\n does not produce any output.\n\n\nRunning a Script Job From the Submit Directory\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo far, we have been running programs (executables) that come with the standard Linux system. \nMore frequently, you will want to run a program that exists within your directory \nor perhaps a simple shell script of commands that you'd like to run within a job. In this example, you will write a shell script and a submit file that runs the shell script within a job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following contents into a file named \ntest-script.sh\n:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\necho\n \n'Date: '\n \n`\ndate\n`\n \n\necho\n \n'Host: '\n \n`\nhostname\n`\n \n\necho\n \n'System: '\n \n`\nuname -spo\n`\n \n\necho\n \n\"Program: \n$0\n\"\n \n\necho\n \n\"Args: \n$*\n\"\n\n\necho\n \n'ls: '\n \n`\nls\n`\n\n\n# END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd executable permissions to the file (so that it can be run as a program):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n chmod +x test-script.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your script from the command line:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ./test-script.sh hello \n42\n \n\nDate: Mon Jul 17 10:02:20 CDT 2017 \n\n\nHost: learn.chtc.wisc.edu \n\n\nSystem: Linux x86_64 GNU/Linux \n\n\nProgram: ./test-script.sh\n\n\nArgs: hello 42\n\n\nls: hostname.sub montage simple.err simple.log simple.out test-script.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is \nreally\n important! If you cannot run your executable from the command-line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine, either. And debugging simple problems like this one is surprisingly difficult. So, if possible, test your \nexecutable\n and \narguments\n as a command at the command-line first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the submit file (this should be getting easier by now):\n\n\nexecutable = test-script.sh\narguments = foo bar baz\n\noutput = script.out\nerror = script.err\nlog = script.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the \nexecutable\n that was named in the submit file did \nnot\n start with a \n/\n, \n    so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. \n    In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs this example shows, blank lines and spaces around the = sign do not matter to HTCondor.\nUse whitespace to make things clear to \nyou\n. What format do you prefer to read?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output (and error, which should be empty).\n\n\nWhat do you notice about the lines returned for \"Program\" and \"ls\"? Remember that only files pertaining\nto \nthis\n job will be in the job working directory on the execute server. You're also seeing the effects\nof HTCondor's need to standardize some filenames when running your job, though they are named as you expect \nin the submission directory (per the submit file contents).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Challenge\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere are Extra Challenges throughout the school curriculum. You may be better off coming back to these after you've completed all other exercises for your current working session.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a simple Python script that does something similar to the shell script above.

The example output below is based on the \nsleep 60\n job.\n\n\nA job log file is updated throughout the life of a job, usually at key events. Each event starts with a heading that indicates what happened and when. Here are \nall\n of the event headings from the \nsleep\n job log (detailed output in between headings has been omitted here):\n\n\n000 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:44:20 Job submitted from host: <128.104.100.43:9618?addrs=...>\n001 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:11 Job executing on host: <128.104.55.42:9618?addrs=...>\n006 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:20 Image size of job updated: 72\n040 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:20 Started transferring output files\n040 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:20 Finished transferring output files\n006 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:46:11 Image size of job updated: 4072\n005 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:46:11 Job terminated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of extra information in those lines, but you can see:\n\n\n\n\nThe job ID: cluster 5739, process 0 (written \n000\n)\n\n\nThe date and local time of each event\n\n\nA brief description of the event: submission, execution, some information updates, and termination\n\n\n\n\nSome events provide no information in addition to the heading. For example:\n\n\n000 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:44:20 Job submitted from host: <128.104.100.43:9618?addrs=...>\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n001 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:11 Job executing on host: <128.104.55.42:9618?addrs=...>\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nEach event ends with a line that contains only 3 dots: \n...\n\n\n\n\nBut the periodic information update event contains some additional information:\n\n\n006 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:45:20 Image size of job updated: 72\n    1  -  MemoryUsage of job (MB)\n    72  -  ResidentSetSize of job (KB)\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nThese updates record the amount of memory that the job is using on the execute machine. This can be helpful information, so that in future runs of the job, you can tell HTCondor how much memory you will need.\n\n\nThe job termination event includes a great deal of additional information:\n\n\n005 (5739.000.000) 07/25 10:46:11 Job terminated.\n    (1) Normal termination (return value 0)\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Local Usage\n    0  -  Run Bytes Sent By Job\n    27848  -  Run Bytes Received By Job\n    0  -  Total Bytes Sent By Job\n    27848  -  Total Bytes Received By Job\n    Partitionable Resources :    Usage  Request Allocated\n       Cpus                 :                 1         1\n       Disk (KB)            :       40       30   4203309\n       Memory (MB)          :        1        1         1\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the most interesting information is:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nreturn value\n (\n0\n here, means the executable completed and didn't indicate any internal errors; non-zero usually means failure)\n\n\nThe total number of bytes transferred each way, which could be useful if your network is slow\n\n\nThe \nPartitionable Resources\n table, especially disk and memory usage, which will inform larger submissions.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other kinds of events, but the ones above will occur in almost every job log.\n\n\nUnderstanding When Job Log Events Are Written\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen are events written to the job log file? Let\u2019s find out. Read through the entire procedure below before starting, because some parts of the process are time sensitive.\n\n\n\n\nChange the \nsleep\n job submit file, so that the job sleeps for 2 minutes (= 120 seconds)\n\n\nSubmit the updated sleep job\n\n\nAs soon as the \ncondor_submit\n command finishes, hit the return key a few times, to create some blank lines\n\n\n\n\nRight away, run a command to show the log file and \nkeep showing\n updates as they occur:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n tail -f sleep.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the output carefully. When do events appear in the log file?\n\n\n\n\nAfter the termination event appears, press Control-C to end the \ntail\n command and return to the shell prompt.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding How HTCondor Writes Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen HTCondor writes the output, error, and log files, does it erase the previous contents of the file or does it add new lines onto the end? Let\u2019s find out!\n\n\nFor this exercise, we can use the \nhostname\n job from earlier.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nhostname\n submit file so that it uses new and unique filenames for output, error, and log files.\n\nAlternatively, delete any existing output, error, and log files from previous runs of the \nhostname\n job.\n\n\nSubmit the job three separate times in a row (there are better ways to do this, which we will cover in the next lecture)\n\n\nWait for all three jobs to finish\n\n\nExamine the output file: How many hostnames are there? Did HTCondor erase the previous contents for each job, or add new lines?\n\n\nExamine the log file\u2026 carefully: What happened there? Pay close attention to the times and job IDs of the events.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about how HTCondor handles these files, you could try finding relevant sections of the manual (this is hard and not as useful as one would hope), discuss it with neighbors or instructors, or ask questions at the end of this session.",

In many HTCondor pools:\n\n\n\n\nIf your job goes over the request values, it may be removed from the execute machine and held (status 'H' in the \ncondor_q\n output, awaiting action on your part) without saving any partial job output files. So it is a disadvantage to not declare your resource needs or if you underestimate them. \n\n\nConversely, if you overestimate them by too much, your jobs will match to fewer slots (and with a longer average wait time) \nand\n you'll be hogging up resources that you don't need, but that could be used for the jobs of other users. In the long run, it works better for all users of the pool if you declare what you really need.\n\n\n\n\nBut how do you know what to request? In particular, we are concerned with memory and disk here; requesting multiple CPUs and using them is covered a bit in later school materials, but true HTC splits work up into jobs that each use as few CPU cores as possible (one CPU core is always best to have the most jobs running and completing soonest).\n\n\nDetermining Resource Needs Before Running Any Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are running short on time, you can skip to \"Determining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs\", below, but try to come back and read over this part at some point.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be very difficult to predict the memory needs of your running program without running tests. Typically, the memory size of a job changes over time, making the task even trickier. \nIf you have knowledge ahead of time about your job\u2019s maximum memory needs, use that, or a maybe a number that's just a bit higher, to be safe. Worst case scenario, you can request a fairly large amount of memory (as high as what's on your laptop or other server, if you know your program can run without crashing) for a first test job, OR you can run the program locally and 'watch' it:\n\n\nExamining a Running Program on a Local Computer\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen working on a shared submit server, you should not run computationally-intensive work because it can use resources needed by HTCondor to manage the queue for all uses. \nHowever, you may have access to other computers (your laptop, for example, or another server) where you can observe the memory usage of a program. The downside is that you'll have to watch a program run for essentially the entire time, to make sure you catch the maximum memory usage.\n\n\nFor Memory:\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn Mac and Windows, for example, the \"Activity Monitor\" and \"Task Manager\" applications may be useful. On a Mac or Linux system, you can use the \nps\n command or the \ntop\n command in the Terminal to watch a running program and see (roughly) how much memory it is using. Full coverage of these tools is beyond the scope of this exercise, but here are two quick examples:\n\n\nUsing \nps\n:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ps ux\n\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n\n\ncat      24342  0.0  0.0  90224  1864 ?        S    13:39   0:00 sshd: cat@pts/0  \n\n\ncat      24343  0.0  0.0  66096  1580 pts/0    Ss   13:39   0:00 -bash\n\n\ncat      25864  0.0  0.0  65624   996 pts/0    R+   13:52   0:00 ps ux\n\n\ncat      30052  0.0  0.0  90720  2456 ?        S    Jun22   0:00 sshd: cat@pts/2  \n\n\ncat      30053  0.0  0.0  66096  1624 pts/2    Ss+  Jun22   0:00 -bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Resident Set Size (\nRSS\n) column, highlighted above, gives a rough indication of the memory usage (in KB) of each running process. If your program runs long enough, you can run this command several times and note the greatest value.\n\n\nUsing \ntop\n:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n top -u <USERNAME>\n\ntop - 13:55:31 up 11 days, 20:59,  5 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.12, 0.09\n\n\nTasks: 198 total,   1 running, 197 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n\n\nCpu(s):  1.2%us,  0.1%sy,  0.0%ni, 98.5%id,  0.2%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.1%si,  0.0%st\n\n\nMem:   4001440k total,  3558028k used,   443412k free,   258568k buffers\n\n\nSwap:  4194296k total,      148k used,  4194148k free,  2960760k cached\n\n\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND\n\n\n24342 cat       15   0 90224 1864 1096 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.26 sshd\n\n\n24343 cat       15   0 66096 1580 1232 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.07 bash\n\n\n25927 cat       15   0 12760 1196  836 R  0.0  0.0   0:00.01 top\n\n\n30052 cat       16   0 90720 2456 1112 S  0.0  0.1   0:00.69 sshd\n\n\n30053 cat       18   0 66096 1624 1236 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.37 bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntop\n command (shown here with an option to limit the output to a single user ID) also shows information about running processes, but updates periodically by itself. Type the letter \nq\n to quit the interactive display. Again, the highlighted \nRES\n column shows an approximation of memory usage.\n\n\nFor Disk:\n\u00b6\n\n\nDetermining disk needs may be a bit simpler, because you can check on the size of files that a program is using while it runs. However, it is important to count all files that HTCondor counts to get an accurate size. HTCondor counts \neverything\n in your job sandbox toward your job\u2019s disk usage:\n\n\n\n\nThe executable itself\n\n\nAll \"input\" files (anything else that gets transferred TO the job, even if you don't think of it as \"input\")\n\n\nAll files created during the job (broadly defined as \"output\"), including the captured standard output and error files that you list in the submit file.\n\n\nAll temporary files created in the sandbox, even if they get deleted by the executable before it's done.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can run your program within a single directory on a local computer (not on the submit server), you should be able to view files and their sizes with the \nls\n and \ndu\n commands.\n\n\nDetermining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs (BEST)\n\u00b6\n\n\nDespite the techniques mentioned above, by far the easiest approach to measuring your job\u2019s resource needs is to run one or a small number of sample jobs and have HTCondor itself tell you about the resources used during the runs.\n\n\nFor example, here is a strange Python script that does not do anything useful, but consumes some real resources while running:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nsize\n \n=\n \n1000000\n\n\nnumbers\n \n=\n \n[]\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nxrange\n(\nsize\n):\n \nnumbers\n.\nappend\n(\nstr\n(\ni\n))\n\n\ntempfile\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\n'temp'\n,\n \n'w'\n)\n\n\ntempfile\n.\nwrite\n(\n' '\n.\njoin\n(\nnumbers\n))\n\n\ntempfile\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n60\n)\n\n\nos\n.\nremove\n(\n'temp'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout trying to figure out what this code does or how many resources it uses, create a submit file for it, \nand run it once with HTCondor, starting with somewhat high memory requests (\"1GB\" for memory and disk is a good starting point, unless you think the job will use far more).\nWhen it is done, examine the log file. In particular, we care about these lines:\n\n\n    Partitionable Resources :    Usage  Request Allocated\n       Cpus                 :                 1         1\n       Disk (KB)            :     6739  1048576   8022934\n       Memory (MB)          :        3     1024      1024\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, now we know that HTCondor saw that the job used 6,739 KB of disk (= about 6.5 MB) and 3 MB of memory!\n\n\nThis is a great technique for determining the real resource needs of your job. If you think resource needs vary from run to run, submit a few sample jobs and look at all the results. And it never hurts to round up your resource requests a little, just in case your job occasionally uses more resources.\n\n\nSetting Resource Requirements\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you know your job\u2019s resource requirements, it is easy to declare them in your submit file. For example, taking our results above as an example, we might slightly increase our requests above what was used, just to be safe:\n\n\nrequest_memory = 4MB  \n# rounded up from 3 MB\n\nrequest_disk = 7MB  \n# rounded up from 6.5 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay close attention to units:\n\n\n\n\nWithout explicit units, \nrequest_memory\n is in MB (megabytes)\n\n\nWithout explicit units, \nrequest_disk\n is in KB (kilobytes)\n\n\nAllowable units are \nKB\n (kilobytes), \nMB\n (megabytes), \nGB\n (gigabytes), and \nTB\n (terabytes)\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor translates these requirements into attributes that become part of the job's \nrequirements\n expression. However, do not put your CPU, memory, and disk requirements directly into the \nrequirements\n expression; use the \nrequest_XXX\n statements instead.\n\n\nIf you still have time in this working session, Add these requirements to your submit file for the Python script, rerun the job, and confirm in the log file that your requests were used.\n\n\nAfter changing the requirements in your submit file, did your job run successfully? If not, why?\n(Hint: HTCondor polls a job's resource use on a timer. How long are these jobs running for?)",

            "text": "The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to test and tune the  request_X  statements in a submit file for when you don't know what resources your job needs.  There are three special resource request statements that you can use (optionally) in an HTCondor submit file:   request_cpus  for the number of CPUs your job will use (most softwares will take an argument to control this number, and it's usually otherwise \"1\")  request_memory  for the maximum amount of run-time memory your job may use  request_disk  for the maximum amount of disk space your job may use (including the executable and all other data that may show up during the job)   HTCondor defaults to certain reasonable values for these request settings, so you do not need to use them to get  small  jobs to run. \nHowever, it is in  YOUR  best interest to always estimate resource requests before submitting any job, but to definitely tune your requests before submitting multiple jobs. In many HTCondor pools:   If your job goes over the request values, it may be removed from the execute machine and held (status 'H' in the  condor_q  output, awaiting action on your part) without saving any partial job output files. So it is a disadvantage to not declare your resource needs or if you underestimate them.   Conversely, if you overestimate them by too much, your jobs will match to fewer slots (and with a longer average wait time)  and  you'll be hogging up resources that you don't need, but that could be used for the jobs of other users. In the long run, it works better for all users of the pool if you declare what you really need.   But how do you know what to request? In particular, we are concerned with memory and disk here; requesting multiple CPUs and using them is covered a bit in later school materials, but true HTC splits work up into jobs that each use as few CPU cores as possible (one CPU core is always best to have the most jobs running and completing soonest).",

It is mainly of interest to people who have their own C code to run (or C++, or really any compiled code, although Java would be handled a bit differently).\n\n\nPreparing a C Executable\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen preparing a C program for HTCondor, it is best to compile and link the executable statically, so that it does not depend on external libraries and their particular versions. Why is this important? When your compiled C program is sent to another machine for execution, that machine may not have the same libraries that you have on your submit machine (or wherever you compile the program).

This small change significantly adds to the kinds of jobs that you can run.\n\n\nViewing a Job Sandbox\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore you learn to transfer files to and from your job, it is good to understand a bit more about the environment in which your job runs. When the HTCondor \nstarter\n process prepares to run your job, it creates a new directory for your job and all of its files. We call this directory the \njob sandbox\n, because it is your job\u2019s private space to play. Let\u2019s see what is in the job sandbox for a very simple job with no special input or output files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the script below in a file named \nsandbox.sh\n:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\necho\n \n'Date: '\n \n`\ndate\n`\n\n\necho\n \n'Host: '\n \n`\nhostname\n`\n \n\necho\n \n'Sandbox: '\n \n`\npwd\n`\n \nls -alF\n\n# END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a submit file for this script and submit it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the job finishes, look at the contents of the output file.\n\n\n\n\nIn the output file, note the \nSandbox:\n line: That is the full path to your job sandbox for the run. It was created just for your job, and it was removed as soon as your job finished.\n\n\nNext, look at the output that appears after the \nSandbox:\n line; it is the output from the \nls\n command in the script. It shows all of the files in your job sandbox, as they existed at the end of the execution of \nsandbox.sh\n. The files are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.chirp.config\n\n\nConfiguration for an advanced feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.job.ad\n\n\nThe job ClassAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.machine.ad\n\n\nThe machine ClassAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_condor_stderr\n\n\nSaved standard error from the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_condor_stdout\n\n\nSaved standard output from the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_exec.exe\n\n\nThe executable, renamed from \nsandbox.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmp/\n\n\nA directory in which to put temporary files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable (\nsandbox.sh\n), renamed it (\ncondor_exec.exe\n), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was \nnot\n transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file.\n\n\nNow that we know something about the sandbox, we can transfer more files to and from it.\n\n\nRunning a Job With Input Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, you will run a job that requires an input file. Remember, the initial job sandbox will contain only the renamed job executable, unless you tell HTCondor explicitly about every other file that needs to be transferred. Fortunately, this is easy.\n\n\nHere is a simple Python script that takes the name of an input file (containing one word per line) from the command line, counts the number of times each (lowercased) word occurs in the text, and prints out the final list of words and their counts.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\n\nif\n \nlen\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \n'Usage: \n%s\n DATA'\n \n%\n \n(\nos\n.\npath\n.\nbasename\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n0\n]))\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n1\n)\n\n\ninput_filename\n \n=\n \nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n\nwords\n \n=\n \n{}\n\n\n\nmy_file\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\ninput_filename\n,\n \n'r'\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nline\n \nin\n \nmy_file\n:\n\n    \nword\n \n=\n \nline\n.\nstrip\n()\n.\nlower\n()\n\n    \nif\n \nword\n \nin\n \nwords\n:\n\n        \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n:\n\n        \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nmy_file\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\n\nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nsorted\n(\nwords\n.\nkeys\n()):\n\n    \nprint\n \n'\n%8d\n \n%s\n'\n \n%\n \n(\nwords\n[\nword\n],\n \nword\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Python script in a file named \nfreq.py\n.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the input file for the script (263K lines, ~1.4 MB) and save it in your submit directory:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool19/mon-2.1-words.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a basic submit file for the \nfreq.py\n executable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line to tell HTCondor to transfer the input file:\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = mon-2.1-words.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all submit file commands, it does not matter where this line goes, as long as it comes before the word \nqueue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not forget to add a line to name the input file as the argument to the Python script.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output!\n\n\n\n\nIf things do not work the first time, keep trying! At this point in the exercises, we are telling you less and less explicitly how to do steps that you have done before. If you get stuck, ask a neighbor or one of the instructors.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you want to transfer more than one input file, list all of them on a single \ntransfer_input_files\n command,\nseparated by commas.\nFor example, if there are three input files:\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = a.txt, b.txt, c.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferring Output Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo far, we have relied on programs that send their output to the standard output and error streams, which HTCondor captures, saves, and returns back to the submit directory. But what if your program writes one or more files for its output? How do you tell HTCondor to bring them back?\n\n\nLet\u2019s start by exploring what happens to files that a job creates in the sandbox. We will use a very simple method for creating a new file: We will copy an input file to another name.\n\n\n\n\nFind or create a small input file (it is fine to use any small file from a previous exercise).\n\n\nCreate a submit file that transfers the input file and copies it to another name (as if doing \n/bin/cp input.txt output.txt\n on the command line)\n\n\nMake the output filename different than any filenames that are in your submit directory\n\n\nWhat is the \nexecutable\n line?\n\n\nWhat is the \narguments\n line?\n\n\nHow do you tell HTCondor to transfer the input file?\n\n\nAs always, use \noutput\n, \nerror\n, and \nlog\n filenames that are different from previous exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job and wait for it to finish.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Can you tell what HTCondor did with the output file that was created (did it end up back on the submit server?), after it was created in the job sandbox? Look carefully at the list of files in your submit directory now.\n\n\nTransferring Specific Output Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs you saw in the last exercise, by default HTCondor transfers files that are created in the job sandbox back to the submit directory when the job finishes. In fact, HTCondor will also transfer back \nchanged\n input files, too. But, this only works for files that are in the top-level sandbox directory, and \nnot\n for ones contained in subdirectories.\n\n\nWhat if you want to bring back only \nsome\n output files, or output files contained in subdirectories?\n\n\nHere is a simple shell script that creates several files, including a copy of an input file in a new subdirectory:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n$#\n -ne \n1\n \n]\n;\n \nthen\n \necho\n \n\"Usage: \n$0\n INPUT\"\n;\n \nexit\n \n1\n;\n \nfi\n\ndate > output-timestamp.txt\ncal > output-calendar.txt\nmkdir subdirectory\ncp \n$1\n subdirectory/backup-\n$1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s confirm that HTCondor does not bring back the output file in the subdirectory:\n\n\n\n\nSave the shell script in a file named \noutput.sh\n.\n\n\nWrite a submit file that transfers an input file and runs \noutput.sh\n on it (passing the filename as an argument).\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you decide that you want only the timestamp output file and all files in the subdirectory, but not the calendar output file. You can tell HTCondor to transfer these specific files:\n\n\ntransfer_output_files = output-timestamp.txt, subdirectory/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSee the trailing slash (\n/\n) on the subdirectory?\nThat tells HTCondor to transfer back \nthe files\n contained in the subdirectory, but not the directory itself;\nthe files will be written directly into the submit directory.\nIf you want HTCondor to transfer back an entire directory, leave off the trailing slash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove all output files from the previous run, including \noutput-timestamp.txt\n and \noutput-calendar.txt\n.\n\n\nCopy the previous submit file that ran \noutput.sh\n and add the \ntransfer_output_files\n line from above.\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory.\n\n\n\n\nDid it work as you expected?\n\n\nThinking About Progress So Far\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, you can do just about everything that you need in order to run jobs on a local HTC pool. You can identify the executable, arguments, and input files, and you can get output back from the job. This is a big achievement!\n\n\nIn some ways, everything after this exercise shows you how to submit multiple jobs at once and makes it easier to run certain kinds of jobs and deal with certain kinds of situations.\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are many more details about HTCondor\u2019s file transfer mechanism not covered here.

This is exactly what a statement like \nqueue 3\n is useful for. Let\u2019s see how it works:\n\n\n\n\nWrite a normal submit file for this program\n\n\nPass 1 million (\n1000000\n) as the command line argument to \ncirclepi\n\n\nRemember to use \nqueue 3\n instead of just \nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file. Note the slightly different message from \ncondor_submit\n:\n\n\n3 job(s) submitted to cluster *NNNN*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the jobs execute, look at the job queue to see the multiple jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some sample \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output:\n\n\n ID       OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD\n\n\n10228.0   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000\n\n\n10228.1   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000\n\n\n10228.2   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sample, all three jobs are part of \ncluster\n \n10228\n, but the first job was assigned \nprocess\n \n0\n, the second job was assigned process \n1\n, and the third one was assigned process \n2\n. (Historical note: Programmers like to start counting from 0, hence the odd numbering scheme.)\n\n\nAt this time, it is worth reviewing the definition of a \njob ID\n. It is a job\u2019s cluster number, a dot (\n.\n), and the job\u2019s process number. So in the example above, the job ID of the second job is \n10228.1\n.\n\n\nPop Quiz:\n Do you remember how to ask HTCondor to list all of the jobs from one cluster? How about one specific job ID?\n\n\nUsing queue \nN\n With Output\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen all three jobs in your single cluster are finished, examine the resulting files.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in the output file?\n\n\nWhat is in the error file (hopefully nothing)?\n\n\nWhat is in the log file? Look carefully at the job IDs in each event.\n\n\nIs this what you expected? Is it what you wanted?\n\n\n\n\nUsing $(Process) to Distinguish Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs you saw with the experiment above, each job ended up overwriting the same output and error filenames in the submission directory.\nAfter all, we didn't tell it to behave any differently when it ran three jobs.\nWe need a way to separate output (and error) files \nper job that is queued\n, not just for the whole cluster of jobs. Fortunately, HTCondor has a way to separate the files easily.\n\n\nWhen processing a submit file, HTCondor will replace any instance of \n$(Process)\n with the process number of the job, for each job that is queued. \nFor example, you can use the \n$(Process)\n variable to define a separate output file name for each job:\n\n\noutput = my-output-file-$(Process).out\nqueue 10\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though the \noutput\n filename is defined only once, HTCondor will create separate output filenames for each job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst job\n\n\nmy-output-file-0.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond job\n\n\nmy-output-file-1.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird job\n\n\nmy-output-file-2.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast (tenth) job\n\n\nmy-output-file-9.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how this works for our program that estimates \u03c0.\n\n\n\n\nIn your submit file, change the definitions of \noutput\n and \nerror\n to use \n$(Process)\n in the filename, similar to the example above.\n\n\nDelete any output, error, and log files from previous runs.\n\n\nSubmit the updated file.\n\n\n\n\nWhen all three jobs are finished, examine the resulting files again.\n\n\n\n\nHow many files are there of each type? What are their names?\n\n\nIs this what you expected? Is it what you wanted from the \u03c0 estimation process?\n\n\n\n\nUsing $(Cluster) to Separate Files Across Runs\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith \n$(Process)\n, you can get separate output (and error) filenames for each job within a run. However, the next time you submit the same file, all of the output and error files are overwritten by new ones created by the new jobs. Maybe this is the behavior that you want. But sometimes, you may want to separate files by run, as well.\n\n\nIn addition to \n$(Process)\n, there is also a \n$(Cluster)\n variable that you can use in your submit files. It works just like \n$(Process)\n, except it is replaced with the cluster number of the entire submission. Because the cluster number is the same for all jobs within a single submission, it does not separate files by job within a submission. But when used \nwith\n \n$(Process)\n, it can be used to separate files by run. For example, consider this \noutput\n statement:\n\n\noutput = my-output-file-$(Cluster)-$(Process).out\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one particular run, it might result in output filenames like \nmy-output-file-2444-0.out\n, \nmyoutput-file-2444-1.out\n, \nmyoutput-file-2444-2.out\n, etc.\n\n\nHowever, the next run would have different filenames, replacing \n2444\n with the new Cluster number of that run.\n\n\nUsing $(Process) and $(Cluster) in Other Statements\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \n$(Cluster)\n and \n$(Process)\n variables can be used in any submit file statement, although they are useful in some kinds of submit file statements and not really for others. For example, consider using $(Cluster) or $(Process) in each of the below:\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\ntransfer_input_files\n\n\ntransfer_output_files\n\n\narguments\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, HTCondor does not easily let you perform math on the \n$(Process)\n number when using it. So, for example, if you use \n$(Process)\n as a numeric argument to a command, it will always result in jobs getting the arguments 0, 1, 2, and so on. If you have control over your program and the way in which it uses command-line arguments, then you are fine. Otherwise, you might need a solution like those in the next exercises.\n\n\n(Optional) Defining JobBatchName for Tracking\n\u00b6\n\n\nDuring the lecture, it was mentioned that you can define arbitrary attributes in your submit file, and that one purpose of such attributes is to track or report on different jobs separately. In this optional exercise, you will see how this technique can be used.\n\n\nOnce again, we will use \nsleep\n jobs, so that your jobs remain in the queue long enough to experiment on.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a basic submit file that runs \nsleep 120\n (or some reasonable duration).\n\n\n\n\nInstead of a single \nqueue\n statement, write this:\n\n\njobbatchname = 1\nqueue 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, quickly edit the submit file to instead say:\n\n\njobbatchname = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck on the submissions using a normal \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n. Of course, your special attribute does not appear in the \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output, but it is present in the \ncondor_q\n output and in each job\u2019s ClassAd. You can see the effect of the attribute by limiting your \ncondor_q\n output to one type of job or another. First, run this command:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -constraint \n'JobBatchName == \"1\"'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you get the output that you expected? Using the example command above, how would you list your other five jobs?\n(More on constraints in other exercises later today.)",

The focus of this exercise is to submit one job per filename that matches a given pattern.\n\n\nIn all cases of submitting many jobs from a single submit file, the key questions are:\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes each job unique? In other words, there is one job per _____?\n\n\nSo, how should you tell HTCondor to distinguish each job?\n\n\n\n\nFor \nqueue *N*\n, jobs are distinguished simply by the built-in \"process\" variable. But with the remaining \nqueue\n forms, you help HTCondor distinguish jobs by other, more meaningful \ncustom\n variables.\n\n\nCounting Words in Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nSuppose you have a collection of books, and you want to analyze how words vary from book to book or author to author. As mentioned in the lecture, HTCondor provides many ways to do this task. You could create a separate submit file for each book, and submit all of the files manually, but you'd have a lot of file lines to modify each time (in particular, all five of the last lines before \nqueue\n below):\n\n\nexecutable              = freq.py\nrequest_memory          = 1GB\nrequest_disk            = 20MB\nshould_transfer_files   = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments            = AAiW.txt\noutput               = AAiW.out\nerror                = AAiW.err\nlog                  = AAiW.log\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nQueue Jobs By Matching Filenames\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor our analysis, we will have a new version of the word-frequency counting script. It takes a single command-line argument, which is the name of the input file containing the text of a book, and it outputs the frequency of each word from least to most common. There will be several book files, and the filename for each book ends with \n.txt\n.\n\n\nThis is an example of a common scenario: We want to run one job per file, where the filenames match a certain consistent pattern. The \nqueue ... matching\n statement is made for this scenario.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see this in action.

Also note that any submit file variable name (here, \nbook\n, but true for \nprocess\n and all others) may be used in any mixture of upper- and lowercase letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor uses the \nqueue ... matching\n statement to look for files in the submit directory that match the given pattern, then queues one job per match. For each job, the given variable (e.g., \nbook\n here) is assigned the name of the matching file, so that it can be used in \noutput\n, \nerror\n, and other statements.\n\n\nThe result is the same as if we had written out a much longer submit file:\n\n\n...\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments = \"AAiW.txt\"\noutput = AAiW.txt.out\nerror = AAiW.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = PandP.txt\narguments = \"PandP.txt\"\noutput = PandP.txt.out\nerror = PandP.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt\narguments = \"TAoSH.txt\"\noutput = TAoSH.txt.out\nerror = TAoSH.txt.err\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some example \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output:\n\n\n ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD\n\n\n  89.0   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py AAiW.txt\n\n\n  89.1   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py PandP.txt\n\n\n  89.2   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py TAoSH.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three jobs were part of cluster 89. The first filename that was matched in the queue statement resulted in a process ID of 0, the second match has a process ID of 1, and the third has a process ID of 2.\n\n\nWhen the three jobs finish, carefully look at the resulting files. Do they match your expectations? There should be a single log file, but three separate output files and three separate (and hopefully empty) error files, one for each job.\n\n\nExtra Challenge\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the example above, you used a single log file for all three jobs. HTCondor handles this situation with no problem; each job writes its events into the log file without getting in the way of other events and other jobs. But as you may have seen, it may be difficult for a person to understand the events for any particular job in the combined log file.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file that works just like the one above, except that each job writes its own log file.",

The result is the same as if we had written out a much longer submit file:  ...\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments = \"AAiW.txt\"\noutput = AAiW.txt.out\nerror = AAiW.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = PandP.txt\narguments = \"PandP.txt\"\noutput = PandP.txt.out\nerror = PandP.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt\narguments = \"TAoSH.txt\"\noutput = TAoSH.txt.out\nerror = TAoSH.txt.err\nqueue  Here is some example  condor_q -nobatch  output:   ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD    89.0   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py AAiW.txt    89.1   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py PandP.txt    89.2   iaross          7/17 11:41   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.0 wordcount.py TAoSH.txt   All three jobs were part of cluster 89. The first filename that was matched in the queue statement resulted in a process ID of 0, the second match has a process ID of 1, and the third has a process ID of 2.

You have already seen that the default mode (as of version 8.5) is to show only your jobs in \"batch\" mode:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've seen that you can view all jobs (all users) in the submit node's queue by using the \n-all\n argument:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -all\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you've seen that you can view more details about queued jobs, with each separate job on a single line using the \n-nobatch\n option:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -nobatch\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -all -nobatch\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know you can also name one or more user IDs on the command line, in which case jobs for all of the named users are listed at once?\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q <USERNAME1> <USERNAME2> <USERNAME3>\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two other, simple selection criteria that you can use. To list just the jobs associated with a single cluster number:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q <CLUSTER>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to see the jobs in cluster 5678 (i.e., \n5678.0\n, \n5678.1\n, etc.), you use \ncondor_q 5678\n.\n\n\nTo list a specific job (i.e., cluster.process, as in 5678.0):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q <JOB.ID>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to see job ID 5678.1, you use \ncondor_q 5678.1\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can name more than one cluster, job ID, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case jobs for\n\nall\n of the named clusters and/or job IDs are listed.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get some practice using \ncondor_q\n selections!\n\n\n\n\nUsing a previous exercise, submit several \nsleep\n jobs.\n\n\nList all jobs in the queue \u2014 are there others besides your own?\n\n\nPractice using all forms of \ncondor_q\n that you have learned:\n\n\nList just your jobs, with and without batching.\n\n\nList a specific cluster.\n\n\nList a specific job ID.\n\n\nTry listing several users at once.\n\n\nTry listing several clusters and job IDs at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen there are a variety of jobs in the queue, try combining a username and a different user's cluster or job ID in the same command \u2014 what happens?\n\n\n\n\nViewing a Job ClassAd\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have wondered why it is useful to be able to list a single job ID using \ncondor_q\n. By itself, it may not be that useful. But, in combination with another option, it is very useful!\n\n\nIf you add the \n-long\n option to \ncondor_q\n (or its short form, \n-l\n), it will show the complete ClassAd for each selected job, instead of the one-line summary that you have seen so far. Because job ClassAds may have 80\u201390 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single job at a time. And you know how to show just one job! Here is what the command looks like:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -long <JOB.ID>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from \ncondor_q\n output (except with some line breaks added to the \nRequirements\n attribute):\n\n\nMyType = \"Job\"\nErr = \"sleep.err\"\nUserLog = \"/home/cat/1-monday-2.1-queue/sleep.log\"\nRequirements = ( IsOSGSchoolSlot =?= true ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) &&\n        ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory ) &&\n        ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer )\nClusterId = 2420\nWhenToTransferOutput = \"ON_EXIT\"\nOwner = \"cat\"\nCondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\"\nOut = \"sleep.out\"\nCmd = \"/bin/sleep\"\nArguments = \"120\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAttributes are listed in no particular order and may change from time to time.\nDo not assume anything about the order of attributes in \ncondor_q\n output.\n\n\n\n\nSee what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a previous exercise, submit a \nsleep\n job that sleeps for at least 3 minutes (180 seconds).\n\n\n\n\nBefore the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file:\n\n\ncondor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-1.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file\n\n\ncondor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-2.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for:\n\n\n\n\nCan you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth)\n\n\nCan you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you? (E.g., Requirements)\n\n\nHow many of the following attributes can you guess the meaning of?\n\n\nDiskUsage\n\n\nImageSize\n\n\nBytesSent\n\n\nJobStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Is My Job Not Running?\n\u00b6\n\n\nSometimes, you submit a job and it just sits in the queue in Idle state, never running. It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help.\n\n\nTo ask HTCondor why your job is not running, add the \n-better-analyze\n option to \ncondor_q\n for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -better-analyze \n2423\n.0\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, replace the job ID with your own.\n\n\nLet\u2019s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/hostname\noutput = norun.out\nerror = norun.err\nlog = norun.log\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\nrequest_disk = 10MB\nrequest_memory = 8TB\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n(Do you see what I did?)\n\n\n\n\nSave and submit this file.\n\n\nRun \ncondor_q -better-analyze\n on the job ID.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample from my own job (with some lines omitted):\n\n\n-- Schedd: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : <128.104.100.148:9618?...\n...\n\nJob 98096.000 defines the following attributes:\n\n    RequestDisk = 10240\n    RequestMemory = 8388608\n\nThe Requirements expression for job 98096.000 reduces to these conditions:\n\n\n         Slots\nStep    Matched  Condition\n-----  --------  ---------\n[1]       11227  Target.OpSysMajorVer == 7\n[9]       13098  TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk\n[11]          0  TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory\n\nNo successful match recorded.\nLast failed match: Fri Jul 12 15:36:30 2019\n\nReason for last match failure: no match found\n\n98096.000:  Run analysis summary ignoring user priority.  Of 710 machines,\n    710 are rejected by your job's requirements\n      0 reject your job because of their own requirements\n      0 match and are already running your jobs\n      0 match but are serving other users\n      0 are able to run your job\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the summary, \ncondor_q\n provides a breakdown of how \nmachines\n and their own requirements match against my own job's requirements. 710 total machines were considered above, and \nall\n of them were rejected based on \nmy job's requirements\n. In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what?\n\n\nFurther up in the output, there is an analysis of the job's requirements, along with how many slots within the pool match each of those requirements. The example above reports that 13098 slots match our small disk request request, but \nnone\n of the slots matched the \nTARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory\n condition. The output also reports the value used for the \nRequestMemory\n attribute: my job asked for \n8 terabytes\n of memory (8,388,608 MB) -- of course no machines matched that part of the expression! That's a lot of memory on today's machines.\n\n\nThe output from \ncondor_q -analyze\n (and \ncondor_q -better-analyze\n) may be helpful or it may not be, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was. But in many cases, this is a good place to start looking if you are having problems matching.\n\n\nBonus: Automatic Formatting Output\n\u00b6\n\n\nDo this exercise only if you have time, though it's pretty awesome!\n\n\nThere is a way to select the specific job attributes you want \ncondor_q\n to tell you about with the \n-autoformat\n or \n-af\n option. In this case, HTCondor decides for you how to format the data you ask for from job ClassAd(s). \n(To tell HTCondor how to specially format this information, yourself, you could use the \n-format\n option, which we're not covering.)\n\n\nTo use autoformatting, use the \n-af\n option followed by the attribute name, for each attribute that you want to output:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -all -af Owner ClusterId Cmd\n\nmoate 2418 /share/test.sh\n\n\ncat 2421 /bin/sleep\n\n\ncat 2422 /bin/sleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Question\n: If you wanted to print out the \nRequirements\n expression of a job, how would you do that with \n-af\n? Is the output what you expected? (HINT: for ClassAd attributes like \"Requirements\" that are long expressions, instead of simple values, you can use \n-af:r\n to view the expressions, instead of what it's current evaluation.)\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs suggested above, if you want to learn more about \ncondor_q\n, you can do some reading:\n\n\n\n\nRead the \ncondor_q\n man page or HTCondor Manual section (same text) to learn about more options\n\n\nRead about ClassAd attributes in Appendix A of the HTCondor Manual",

You've already learned the basic \ncondor_status\n and the \ncondor_status -compact\n variation (which you may wish to retry now, before proceeding).\n\n\nAnother convenient option is to list only those slots that are available now:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -avail\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the individual execute machines only report their slots to the collector at certain time intervals, so this list will not reflect the up-to-the-second reality of all slots. But this limitation is true of all \ncondor_status\n output, not just with the \n-avail\n option.\n\n\nSimilar to \ncondor_q\n, you can limit the slots that are listed in two easy ways. To list just the slots on a specific machine:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status <hostname>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to see the slots on \ne242.chtc.wisc.edu\n (in the CHTC pool):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status e242.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nTo list a specific slot on a machine:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status <slot>@<hostname>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to see the \u201cfirst\u201d slot on the machine above:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status slot1@e242.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can name more than one hostname, slot, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case slots for\n\nall\n of the named hostnames and/or slots are listed.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get some practice using \ncondor_status\n selections!\n\n\n\n\nList all slots in the pool \u2014 how many are there total?\n\n\nPractice using all forms of \ncondor_status\n that you have learned:\n\n\nList the available slots.\n\n\nList the slots on a specific machine (e.g., \ne242.chtc.wisc.edu\n).\n\n\nList a specific slot from that machine.\n\n\nTry listing the slots from a few (but not all) machines at once.\n\n\nTry using a mix of hostnames and slot IDs at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing a Slot ClassAd\n\u00b6\n\n\nJust as with \ncondor_q\n, you can use \ncondor_status\n to view the complete ClassAd for a given slot (often confusingly called the \u201cmachine\u201d ad):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -long <slot>@<hostname>\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause slot ClassAds may have 150\u2013200 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single slot at a time, as shown above.\n\n\nHere are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from \ncondor_status\n output:\n\n\nOpSys = \"LINUX\"\nDetectedCpus = 24\nOpSysAndVer = \"SL6\"\nMyType = \"Machine\"\nLoadAvg = 0.99\nTotalDisk = 798098404\nOSIssue = \"Scientific Linux release 6.6 (Carbon)\"\nTotalMemory = 24016\nMachine = \"e242.chtc.wisc.edu\"\nCondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\"\nMemory = 1024\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may be able to tell, there is a mix of attributes about the machine as a whole (hence the name \u201cmachine ad\u201d) and about the slot in particular.\n\n\nGo ahead and examine a machine ClassAd now. I suggest looking at one of the slots on, say, \ne242.chtc.wisc.edu\n because of its relatively simple configuration.\n\n\nViewing Slots by ClassAd Expression\n\u00b6\n\n\nOften, it is helpful to view slots that meet some particular criteria. For example, if you know that your job needs a lot of memory to run, you may want to see how many high-memory slots there are and whether they are busy. You can filter the list of slots like this using the \n-constraint\n option and a ClassAd expression.\n\n\nFor example, suppose we want to list all slots that are running Scientific Linux 7 (operating system) and have at least 16 GB memory available. Note that memory is reported in units of Megabytes. The command is:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -constraint \n'OpSysAndVer == \"CentOS7\" && Memory >= 16000'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe very careful with using quote characters appropriately in these commands.\nIn the example above, the single quotes (\n'\n) are for the shell, so that the entire expression is passed to\n\ncondor_status\n untouched, and the double quotes (\n\"\n) surround a string value within the expression itself.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently on CHTC, there are only a few slots that meet these criteria (our high-memory servers, mainly used for metagenomics assemblies).\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about writing ClassAd expressions, look at section 4.1 and especially 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual. This is definitely advanced material, so if you do not want to read it, that is fine. But if you do, take some time to practice writing expressions for the \ncondor_status -constraint\n command.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ncondor_q\n command accepts the \n-constraint\n option as well!\nAs you might expect, the option allows you to limit the jobs that are listed based on a ClassAd expression.\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Formatting Output\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \ncondor_status\n command accepts the same \n-autoformat\n (\n-af\n) options that \ncondor_q\n accepts, and the options have the same meanings in both commands. Of course, the attributes available in machine ads may differ from the ones that are available in job ads. Use the HTCondor Manual or look at individual slot ClassAds to get a better idea of what attributes are available.\n\n\nFor example, I was curious about the Windows slots listed in the \ncondor_status\n summary output. Here are two commands that show the full hostnames and major version information for the Windows slots:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -af Machine -af OpSysAndVer -constraint \n'OpSys == \"WINDOWS\"'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, spend a few minutes now or later experimenting with \ncondor_status\n formatting.\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs suggested above, if you want to learn more about \ncondor_q\n, you can do some reading:\n\n\n\n\nRead the \ncondor_status\n man page or HTCondor Manual section (same text) to learn about more options\n\n\nRead about \nClassAd attributes\n in the appendix of the HTCondor Manual\n\n\nRead about \nClassAd expressions\n in section 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual",

In the real world, we would probably just fix the program, but what if you cannot change the software? Unfortunately, this situation happens more often than we would like.\n\n\nBelow is a simple Python script that fails once in a while. We will not fix it, but use it to simulate a program that can fail and that we \ncannot\n fix.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# murphy.py simulates a real program with real problems\nimport random\nimport sys\nimport time\n\n# Create a random number seeded by system entropy\nr = random.SystemRandom()\n\n# One time in three, simulate a runtime error\nif (r.randint(0,2) == 0):\n    # intentionally print no output\n    sys.exit(15)\nelse:\n    time.sleep(3)\n    print \"All work done correctly\"\n\n# By convention, zero exit code means success\nsys.exit(0)\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if you are not a Python expert, you may be able to figure out what this program does.\n\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when a program like this one is run in HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\nIn a new directory for this exercise, save the script above as \nmurphy.py\n.\n\n\nWrite a submit file for the script; \nqueue 20\n instances of the job and be sure to ask for 20\u00a0MB of memory and disk.\n\n\nSubmit the file, note the ClusterId, and wait for the jobs to finish.\n\n\n\n\nWhat output do you expect? What output did you get? If you are curious about the exit code from the job, it is saved in completed jobs in \ncondor_history\n in the \nExitCode\n attribute. The following command will show the \nExitCode\n for a given cluster of jobs:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_history <CLUSTER> -af ProcId ExitCode\n\n\n\n\n\n(Be sure to replace \n<cluster>\n with your actual cluster ID. The command may take a minute or so to complete.)\n\n\nHow many of the jobs succeeded? How many failed?\n\n\nRetrying Failed Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow let\u2019s see if we can solve the problem of jobs that fail once in a while. In this particular case, if HTCondor runs a failed job again, it has a good chance of succeeding. Not all failing jobs are like this, but in this case it is a reasonable assumption.\n\n\nFrom the lecture materials, implement the \nmax_retries\n feature to retry any job with a non-zero exit code up to 5 times, then resubmit the jobs. Did your change work?\n\n\nAfter the jobs have finished, examine the log file(s) to see what happened in detail. Did any jobs need to be restarted? Another way to see how many restarts there were is to look at the \nNumJobStarts\n attribute of a completed job with the \ncondor_history\n command, in the same way you looked at the \nExitCode\n attribute earlier. Does the number of retries seem correct? For those jobs which did need to be retried, what is their \nExitCode\n; and what about the \nExitCode\n from earlier execution attempts?\n\n\nA (Too) Long Running Job\n\u00b6\n\n\nSometimes, an ill-behaved job will get stuck in a loop and run forever, instead of exiting with a failure code, and it may just need to be re-run (or run on a different execute server) to complete without getting stuck. We can modify our Python program to simulate this kind of bad job with the following file:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# murphy.py simulate a real program with real problems\nimport random\nimport sys\nimport time\n\n# Create a random number seeded by system entropy\nr = random.SystemRandom()\n\n# One time in three, simulate an infinite loop\nif (r.randint(0,2) == 0):\n        # intentionally print no output\n        time.sleep(3600)\n        sys.exit(15)\nelse:\n        time.sleep(3)\n        print \"All work done correctly\"\n\n# By convention, zero exit code means success\nsys.exit(0)\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, you may be able to figure out what this new program does.\n\n\n\n\nSave the script to a new file named \nmurphy2.py\n.\n\n\nCopy your previous submit file to a new name and change the \nexecutable\n to \nmurphy2.py\n.\n\n\nIf you like, submit the new file\u00a0\u2014 but after a while be sure to remove the whole cluster to clear out the \u201chung\u201d jobs.\n\n\n\n\nNow try to change the submit file to automatically remove any jobs that \nrun\n for more than one minute. You can make this change with just a single line in your submit file\n\n\nperiodic_remove = (JobStatus == 2) && ( (CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > 60 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the new file. Do the long running jobs get removed? What does \ncondor_history\n show for the cluster after all jobs are done? Which job status (i.e. idle, held, running) do you think \nJobStatus == 2\n corresponds to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Exercise\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you have time, edit your submit file so that instead of removing long running jobs, have HTCondor automatically put the long-running job on hold, and then automatically release it.",
