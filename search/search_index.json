Gaining access is critical for all remaining exercises.\n\n\nLogging In\n\u00b6\n\n\nToday, you will use a submit server named \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, which will allow you to submit jobs to our local HTCondor pool in CHTC.\n\n\nTo log in, use a \nSecure Shell\n (SSH) client.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a Mac or Linux computer, run the Terminal app and use the \nssh\n command, like so:\n\n\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ssh \n<USERNAME>\n@learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, we recommend a free client called \nPuTTY\n, but any SSH client should be fine.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need help finding or using an SSH client, ask the instructors for help right away\n!\n\n\nAbout Your Password\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nYour username and initial password are located on the Accounts sheet of paper that you received this morning\n\n\nWhile the \npasswd\n command will work (and will change your password temporarily), your initial password will be automatically reset for you on an hourly basis. (So you probably don't want to change your password, in the first place, and definitely want to keep your sheet of paper or memorize the password).\n\n\n\n\nRunning Commands\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the exercises, we will show commands that you are supposed to type or copy into the command line, like this:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n hostname\n\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the first line of the example above, the \nusername@learn $\n part is meant to show the Linux command-line prompt.\nYou do not type this part! Further, your actual prompt probably is a bit different, and that is expected.\nSo in the example above, the command that you type at your own prompt is just the eight characters \nhostname\n.\nThe second line of the example, without the prompt, shows the output of the command; you do not type this part,\neither.\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few other commands that you can try (the examples below do not show the output from each command):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n whoami\n\nusername@learn $\n date\n\nusername@learn $\n uname -a\n\n\n\n\n\nA suggestion for the day: Try typing into the command line as many of the commands as you can. Copy-and-paste is fine, of course, but \nyou WILL learn more if you take the time to type each command, yourself.\n\n\nOrganizing Your Workspace\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou will be doing many different exercises over the next few days, many of them on this submit server. Each exercise may use many files, once finished. To avoid confusion, it may be useful to create a separate directory for each exercise.\n\n\nFor instance, for the rest of this exercise, you may wish to create and use a directory named \nmonday-1.1-login\n, or something like that.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n mkdir Mon\n\nusername@learn $\n mkdir Mon/1.1\n\nusername@learn $\n \ncd\n Mon/1.1\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the Version of HTCondor\n\u00b6\n\n\nHTCondor is installed on this server. But what version? You can ask HTCondor itself:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_version\n\n$\nCondorVersion: \n8\n.9.2 May \n13\n \n2019\n BuildID: \n469000\n PackageID: \n8\n.9.2-0.469000 $\n\n$\nCondorPlatform: x86_64_RedHat7 $\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the output, we are using HTCondor 8.9.2.\n\n\nFYI: Background information about HTCondor version numbers\n\u00b6\n\n\nHTCondor always has two types of releases at one time: stable and development. HTCondor 8.6.x and 8.8.x are considered stable releases, indicated by even-numbered second digits (e.g., 6 or 8 in these cases). Within one stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 8.6.0 and 8.6.8 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug and security fixes.\n\n\nHTCondor 8.9.2 is the latest \ndevelopment\n release series of HTCondor. You know that these are a development release because the second digit (i.e., 9) is an odd number. CHTC is usually running the latest development series as the local CHTC Pool is somewhat of a final testing ground for new features. Other HTCondor pools and submit servers that you use outside of CHTC (including the OSG submit server you'll use later) may run different versions. In general, the user-facing HTCondor features in 8.6 forward are mostly the same, but you may see some differences in the format of output from \ncondor_\n commands or in more advanced or non-user features.\n\n\nReference Materials\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere are a few links to reference materials that might be interesting after the school (or perhaps during).\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor home page\n\n\nHTCondor manuals\n; it is probably best to read the manual corresponding to the version of HTCondor that you use (8.9.2 for today)\n\n\nCenter for High Throughput Computing\n, our campus research computing center, and home to HTCondor and other development of distributed computing tools",
