# OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">A new opportunity for a new time.</p>

The [OSG User School 2020](https://opensciencegrid.org/user-school-2020/) has been canceled due to
the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some of the applicants who were selected for this year&rsquo;s User School
have chosen to try a new offering: The OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020.  Rather than simply translate
the User School for remote participation, the goal is to offer a new consulting and training event
in which each participant works to get their research computing running within the two week period.

The Pilot will be held the weeks of July 13 and 20.  If successful, OSG may consider offering this
kind of event again.

More information about the Pilot, including schedule and materials for participants, will be posted
soon!
